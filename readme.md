**Project Requirements**:  
-------------------

**Module Requirements**:



3. **Prevent Duplicate Letters**: Modify the game so that it doesn't accept the same letter twice. i.e guessing a previously accepted letter should be counted as a mistake. 

4. **Fix the Graphics Glitch**: There's a glitch in the graphics. Find and fix it. This task exposes you to the debugging process and gives you practice in understanding and correcting issues.

5. **Fix the Off-by-One Error**: There's a latent off-by-one error in the code. Such errors are a common type of logical error in programming. Identify and correct this error.

6. **Fix the Final Drawing Bug**: There's a bug that prevents the final drawing from being displayed. Debug and fix this issue.

7. **Extend the Number of Attempts**: The player's number of attempts to guess the word is limited. Extend this number in a meaningfull way.


**Challenge Requirements (Higher Grades)**:

1. **Add a Hint Option**: Implement a feature that reveals a letter in the word when activated. 

2. **Implement a High Score System**: Track the fewest attempts to guess a word. This exposes you file I/O and adds a competitive element to the game.

3. **File-Based Word List**: At startup, your game should retrieve the list of possible words from the file "words.txt". This gives you practice with file I/O operations and managing external resources.
