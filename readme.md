In this module I faced the challenge of proper code structure. Currently there are a lot of functions floating around in Hangman.cs. Functions that I could probably put into a different utilities.cs file or something of the sort. 

I also learned how to both get, display and write from a file.txt. As well as comparing that value other values. 

My debugging skills have also been improved which is also fun. 

For the next game I should plan out my classes more so its not so cluttered.
